# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Analysis
A Colorado Board of Elections has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote
6. Identify which counties participated in the election
7. Calcuate voter turnout by county  
8. Identify which county had the largest turnout

## Resouces
- Data Souce: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Jupyter Lab 1.4.1

## Results








## Summary

This script has the ability to perform detailed analysis of data stored in CSV files and produces results in both a straight-forward text file and printed in the command line. While the outputs may need additional modifications to be more appealing and intuitive, the script itself is able to handle large data volumes very quickly. To increase the use and scale of this script such that it could be used for any election, regaurdless of data volumes, it would be necceasy to build in data cleaning mechanisms that can deal with anomalies, and it would be useful to create functions that can be called to identify whether the data is sorted by city, township, county, state, etc. The hard-coded county variables would need to be more flexible, perhaps using user input via message boxes.
